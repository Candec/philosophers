Allowed functions:

| # | Function | Description | Prototype |
|:-:|:---------|:------------|:----------|
| 1 | [memset()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memset.3.html)       | Fills the first 'n' bytes of the memory area pointed to by 's' with the constant byte 'c'.| void *ft_memset(void *s, int c, size_t n)|
| 2 | [printf()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html)       | The functions printf() writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.| int printf(const char *restrict format, ...)|
| 3 | [malloc()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html)       | The malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.| void *malloc(size_t size)|
| 4 | [free()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/free.3.html)         | The free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc()| void free(void *ptr)|
| 5 | [usleep()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/free.3.html)         | The usleep() function suspends execution of the calling thread for (at least) usec microseconds.| int usleep(useconds_t usec)|
| 6 | [gettimeofday()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettimeofday.2.html) | The function gettimeofday() can get the time as well as a timezone.| int gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict tv, struct timezone *restrict tz)|
| 7 | [pthread_create()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html) |  The pthread_create() function starts a new thread in the calling process. The new thread starts execution by invoking start_routine() arg is passed as the sole argument of start_routine().| int pthread_create(pthread_t *restrict thread, const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr, void \*(\*start_routine)(void *), void *restrict arg)|
| 8 | [pthread_detach()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_detach.3.html) | The pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by thread as detached.  When a detached thread terminates, its resources are automatically released back to the system without the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.| int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread)|
| 9 | [pthread_join()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_join.3.html) | The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by thread to terminate. If that thread has already terminated, then pthread_join() returns immediately. The thread pecified by thread must be joinable.| int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval)|
| 10 | [pthread_mutex_init()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_mutex_init.3p.html) | The pthread_mutex_init() initialize a mutex | int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *restrict mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr)  pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER|
| 11 | [pthread_mutex_destroy()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_mutex_init.3p.html) | The pthread_mutex_destroy() destroy a mutex | int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)|
| 12 | [pthread_mutex_lock()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_mutex_lock.3p.html) |  The mutex object referenced by mutex shall be locked by a call to pthread_mutex_lock() that returns zero or \[EOWNERDEAD\]. | int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)|
| 13 | [pthread_mutex_lock()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_mutex_unlock.3p.html) |  The mutex object referenced by mutex shall be unlocked by a call to pthread_mutex_unlock() that returns zero or \[EOWNERDEAD\]. | int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)|
